/*******************
 * 3.0 Beta 04
 * 2012-04-?? /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *********/
 * On the bottom of the user's ViewEntries, visible for managers and up, we have
   added a log entry ViewList with log entries linked to the user.
 * Fixed bug; Variants imported from VCF and SeattleSeq files were sometimes
   incorrectly described as inversions.
 * Automatic mapping will now create several gene entries if a single variant
   can be mapped onto more than one gene.
 * Automatically mapped variants now get a VariantOnTranscript/Protein
   description.
 * Variants imported from VCF files will now get DB-ID's even if automatic
   mapping has been turned off.
 * Fixed bug; the automatic mapping script would crash with a PHP fatal error if
   it tries to get gene information from the HGNC for a deprecated gene symbol.
 * Fixed bug; The "make standard" AJAX call made from the SeattleSeq import form
   did not actually make the column standard because of a problem in the call.
 * Fixed bug; Submission emails sent out by LOVD by users with more than one
   email address, had the additional addresses in the body of the email.
 * Fixed bug; The /transcripts/GENE URL also showed transcripts for genes with
   symbols starting with the requested gene symbol.
 * Fixed bug; The number of variants shown in the individuals listing, showed
   the number of variants found in the first screening instead of the total
   number of variants found.
   (thanks to Chris Watson, St. James's Univ Hospital, Leeds, UK, for reporting)
 * Fixed bug; The custom column data type wizard was resetting a textarea's size
   to 40 every time the wizard ran.




 * Fixed bug; Fixed the bug that searching in a
   (created|edited|updated|owned)_by column would result in an invalid search
   syntax error.
 * Fixed bug; Sometimes the footer would not be included when an error occurred.
 * Fixed bug; Now preventing javascript injection in the custom columns data
   type wizard.
 * Implemented confirmed variants into the submission mail process.
 * Now writing to log if the mail to the curator(s) failed at the end of a
   submission and also added a notification of the error to the user.
 * Added some checks to screenings?confirm so that users cannot confirm variants
   when they are not allowed.
 * Added some examples to the standard custom link descriptions.
 * Renamed `VariantOnGenome/DNA_published` to `VariantOnGenome/Published_as` &
   `VariantOnTranscript/DNA_published` to `VariantOnTranscript/Published_as`.
 * Changed the page the user goes to when a column is enabled or
   removed/disabled.

   `Phenotype/Inheritance`, `VariantOnGenome/Genetic_origin` and
   `VariantOnGenome/Segregation` to the standard available set of columns.
 * Added allele and variant effect columns to some of the variant views.
 * Fixed bug; Fixed a notice saying the function called array_replace does not
   exist, because it is not available before PHP 5.3.0.

   tooltip don't disappear at the bottom edge of the page.
 * Added the allele field to some variant viewLists.
 * Fixed the variant counts in the genes viewList.
 * Leaving the proxy_port empty during install, would cause it to be stored as 0
   instead of NULL in the database, this is now fixed.
 * Changed all implementations of `VariantOnGenome/DBID` so that it can only
   contain the DBID itself and nothing extra.




/*******************
 * 3.0 Beta 03

 * Fixed bug; "Not authorized" messages would include the header even if the
   "clean" header was already included before.
 * Fixed bug; On servers where MySQL had the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY setting enabled,
   custom columns could not be edited nor enabled.

/*******************
 * 3.0 Beta 02
 * 2012-02-09
 *********/
 * Went through the entire 2Do.txt file to resort the new priorities after
   3.0-beta-01.
 * The installation process now checks if MultiViews or mod_rewrite (or
   something equivalent on non-Apache servers) is activated. It also checks for
   the PHP function xml_parser_create().
   Closes #4: "Problems running LOVD 3.0 on Windows 7/WampServer 2.0".
 * Updated the INSTALL.txt to reflect this.
 * Removed link to LOVD status page for now since we haven't implemented it yet.

 * When there is only one user in the database, after creating a gene you are no
   longer forwarded to the "Add curator" page.
 * Fixed display problem with the disease entry form when there are genes with
   long names.
 * Fixed bug; Searching for !="" still showed entries with empty values in the
   specified column.
 * Fixed bug; Searching for values in custom columns used the slower HAVING SQL
   syntax instead of the optimized WHERE syntax.
 * When searching for negative matches (e.g. "!DMD" which means "does not match
   DMD"), the NULL values were ignored and not returned.
 * Fixed bug; The progress bar shown while upgrading did not calculate the total
   work correctly, making a weird "jump" at the end.
 * Fixed accidentially changed field length for the VariantOnGenome/Frequency
   field.
 * Fixed bug; The checks on the Panel ID field were not adequate.
 * Fixed bug; When running the data type wizard twice on the same form, the pre-
   vious values were not remembered.

   individual" & "Add a phenotype to this individual" are now only visible when
   the user is the owner of the data, curator or higher.
 * You can now specify that no variants were found with a particular screening.
 * Now a user is only able to select up to 15 genes that have been screened in
   the screenings create & edit forms. For genome-wide analysis no genes should 
   be selected.
 * Fixed bug; The DBID was not properly predicted in some cases.
 * Fixed bug; When creating a gene, there were in some specific cases no proper
   checks if the gene was already present in the database.
 * Removed the separator line in the tab menu's when there are no items after
   it.
 * Added some mod_rewrite rules that we had forgotten to add before.


/*******************
 * 3.0 Beta 01
 * 2012-01-31
 *********/
 * Fixed bug; Sometimes transcripts where shown under a gene's detailed view
   that belonged to genes with only a similar name.
   Closes #6: "showing active transcripts".
 * Fixed bug; Password reset tried to send an email even if the user was unknown
   but it threw a PHP error instead. Also, you can no longer check if a username
   exists by using this function.
 * The default page size for the viewList used to select curators is now 10.
 * Fixed notices in columns.php.
 * Fixed bug; Removing a VariantOnTranscript column that has been added to many

 * Fixed bug; Prevented a variant from being added to the same screening every
   time due to a bug in the code.
 * Fixed bug; Prevented a notice from occurring regarding the chromosome in the
   variant edit form.
 * Fixed bug; Variants which were not public where still viewable in some
   viewLists.
 * Rewrote the submission mailing process, so that screenings & phenotypes can
   be added to an individual properly with a notification mail to the curator(s)
   and such.
 * Implemented panelid & panel size.
 * Implemented VariantOnGenome/DBID check & predict functions into the variant
   create and edit forms.
 * Corrected some pathogenicity error messages on the variant forms.
 * Fixed bug; Installing LOVD would cause a notice, because pathogenicity was
   not yet changed to functional effect.

   transcripts.
 * Changed the VariantOnGenome/DBID descriptions, regular expression pattern
   check and form type for the new LOVD3 implementation.

   this has now been fixed.
 * Changed the default width for "VariantOnGenome/DBID" from 200 to 80.
 * Added a new database table to correctly sort the chromosomes.
 * Variant start & stop positions are now stored in the database, to facilitate
   correct sorting of the variants.


/*******************
 * 3.0 Alpha 07
 * 2011-12-14
 *********/
 * Fixed bug; When a gene has been selected, the disease tab was always linking
   to diseases associated to the DMD gene, even if there was no DMD gene.

   lovd_requireAuth(), which made lovd_requireAuth() print a wrong error message
   when a user did not have proper rights to view a page.
 * Reimplemented /variants/GENE viewList - the variants can now only be viewed
   per transcript. The viewer can switch transcripts if others are available for
   the selected gene. Also created the /variants/GENE/NM_ID URL, which locks the
   view on the given transcript.
 * When viewing a variant's details, the affected transcripts now also mention
   the gene symbol.

 * Added the /view/GENE page that shows variant, screening and individual data
   joined to each other, per gene, like was done in LOVD 2.0.
 * Changed the dbSNP custom link so that it can accept "rs1234567" as well as
   just "1234567".
 * Fixed bug; The VariantOnTranscripts ViewList did not show any active custom
   columns.
 * Added the "Affects function" selection list to all variant create & edit 
   forms, which will be the replacement of the "Pathogenicity" field from LOVD2.
 * Added the option M (mitochondrial) to the chromosome selection list when
   creating a genomic variant.
 * Added support for editing a variant that affects transcripts of more than one
   gene.
 * Added a "loading..." image when the map variants button is pressed in the
   variant create & edit form.

 * Added the "Collaborates" column to the user's viewEntry, visible from Manager
   and up.
 * Fixed bug; The built-in Mutalyzer Syntax Checker on the variant create form
   didn't work for variants on non-numeric chromosomes, due to misinterpretation
   of 'chrX' as a malformed reference sequence.
 * When visiting gene-specific pages, LOVD now creates the gene-specific header
   with the list of curators displayed on the top of the page, like in LOVD 2.0.
 * LOVD also remembers your selected gene while you are active in LOVD, and some
   tabs' links are adapted to direct you to gene-specific overviews directly.
 * Improved the PDO wrapper by implementing a PDOStatement::fetchAllAssoc().

   down menu because of a bug in IE.
 * Added the protein NCBI ID column to the transcript viewList.
 * Fixed bug; Using the back button in your browser didn't always work properly
   when searching data using viewLists.
 * Fixed notice on phenotype data entry form.
 * Clicking on an entry in the "variant affecting transcripts" viewList now also
   links to the entry's viewEntry, and custom links are now displayed properly.
 * Fixed bug; The viewLists of individuals, screenings and phenotypes has no
   functional anchor.
 * Fixed bug; "Owned by" and "Status" fields are now only editable for curators
   and higher. The status of entries edited by the data owner, will be lowered
   to Marked, if it was set to Public.
 * Fixed bug; When leaving a Date data field empty, the database stored
   "0000-00-00".
 * Fixed bug; Internet Explorer users could be having some trouble with links

   in LOVD.
 * Fixed bug; sorting in genes?sortCurator & columns?order now also works for IE
   by using jQuery UI sortable.
   Fixed #1: "Drag and drop sorting does not work in IE 8".
 * Fixed bug; Changed the temporary memory leak fix to a solid permanent fix in
   genes?create, genes?edit & transcripts?create.

   led to execution of javascript outside the scope of the page, resulting in a
   blank page with only "true" on it.
 * Fixed bug; Users can no longer remove a user as curator for a gene, when this
   user has an equal or higher level than themselves.
 * Fixed bug; Fixed notices when not properly selecting a curator for a gene.
 * Added the "Order" column in the custom columns viewList.
 * Simplified the check on the regular expression syntax of a custom column.
 * Fixed bug; On the gene viewEntry pages one of the headers was malformed.
 * Implemented option for curators to sort the list of curators for their genes.
 * Implemented lovd_isAuthorized() for checking a user's authorization for dif-
   ferent data types. Currently, only genes are implemented. The user's level,
   if lower than LEVEL_MANAGER, will no longer be defined in inc-auth.php.
 * Curators of any gene can now also check LOVD's update status. The link to
   this page is now only active for Curators and up.
 * Added navigation for Curators from the gene viewEntry page to forms to edit a
   gene, add a transcript to a gene, and sort the list of curators. Those pages
   are now also opened up to Curators.
 * Minimum MySQL version needed to run LOVD 3.0 is now 4.1.1.
 * Added lovd_php_htmlspecialchars() function that also works recursively.
 * Added array_merge() optimization where possible.
 * Fixed bug; Values of custom columns configured as simple drop down lists were
   lost during edit of the data entry.
 * Fixed bug; On the genomic variant data entry form, "Owner of individual"
   should be "Owner of variant". Also other forms had this error.
   (thanks to Raymond Dalgleish, University of Leicester, UK, for reporting)
 * Links to OMIM are now to OMIM.org and not to the NCBI site anymore.
 * Fixed bug; The user's viewList and viewEntry reported collaborators as being
   curators for the genes they are collaborators for.
 * Implemented lovd_isAuthorized() checks for diseases and transcripts, so that
   curators can correctly be recognized as authorized users.
 * Added virtual user level LEVEL_OWNER, assigned by lovd_isAuthorized() to sub-
   mitters who are owner or creator of a certain data entry.
 * Fixed too big Variant/DBID size on the data entry form.
 * Fixed bug and standardized code for checks on ownerid and statusid.
 * Fixed bug; When all available users had been selected as curator or
   collaborator, you were not able to remove anyone from this list anymore.
 * Fixed bug; Internet Explorer "forgot" which columns where hidden from view in
   viewLists when searching or sorting them.
 * Fixed bug; A change applied to lovd_php_file() in r46 failed on servers with
   PHP 4, so included work around.
 * Checking the user's password for authorization of creates, edits and deletes
   is now handled by class/objects.php.
 * Fixed bug; On input errors, some data entry forms did not delete the password
   after the form was sent back.
 * Fixed bug; All custom columns can now be removed properly.
 * Fixed bug; When a user edits a gene, LOVD checks if there is a known UD number
   in the database. If not, then it generates one through mutalyzer.
 * Implemented a re-ordering functionality of custom columns.
 * Changed the regular expression for gene symbol validity so that it can also
   contain @ and #.
 * Implemented a urldecode and urlencode in genes.php to allow special chars
   to be in the gene symbol and thus in the URL.
 * Implemented automatic exploding of GROUP_CONCAT data based on their name. 
   So '_genes' = array (;) or '__active_diseases' = nested array(;;).
 * Added the temporary memory leak fix from genes?create also to genes?edit &
   transcripts?create.
 * Fixed bug; Variants can be added to a screening again. Still this is only
   possible from the screenings page when you select "Add variant to screening".
 * The proper columns are now loaded also for transcript variants in
   object_custom.php.
 * Implemented tooltips for custom links in viewLists, inside the tooltip is the
   actual link so that they are now clickable without going to the viewEntry.
 * User levels are now properly displayed in user viewLists & viewEntries and
   sortable (not searchable).


/*******************
 * 3.0 Alpha 02
 * 2011-07-05
 *********/
 * Fixed bug; Windows systems will now be able to send mails to the users when
   using reset password.
 * Fixed bug; Appropriate email headers are now added to the LOVD system mail
   function.
 * Fixed bug; Temporary fix for the memory leak in /genes?create.
 * Fixed bug; Order of custom columns is now set correctly when enabled.
 * Create, edit & delete phenotype are now implemented and working properly.
 * User authorization level is now searchable in viewLists.
 * Custom columns can now be removed.
 * Adapted the page for phenotype create a bit.
 * Changed & to W3C compliant &amp; in HTML output.
 * Some LOVD 2.0 -> LOVD 3.0 code standardizations.
 * Some code optimizations.
 * insertEntry() and updateEntry() don't need to implode array values,
   lovd_queryDB() does that for them already.
 * Changed "variant information entry" to "variant entry".
 * Added new logos for gene database create and edit.
 * Removed remaining carriage returns in all files except the
   config.ini.php-lovd.
 * Removed internal LOVD columns from the VariantsOnTranscripts' viewList and
   viewEntry.
 * Fixed bug; Non-shared custom columns couldn't be removed.
 * Used CURRENT_PATH instead of (possibly concatenated) $_PATH_ELEMENTS calls.
 * Added new screening techniques to the "Screening/Technique" column.
 * Fixed bug; The "VariantOnTranscript/RNA" and "VariantOnTranscript/Protein"
   columns were non-mandatory by mistake.
 * Fixed bug; The "updated" column in the genes viewList did not allow for date
   type searching because lovd_getColumnType() did not recognize it.
 * Fixed bug; Notices were thrown when searching in date columns using
   incomplete date ranges.
 * Cleaned out the 2Do.txt file; bugs that had been fixed already were removed.
 * Added anchor in columns viewList.
 * The "Last login" and "Started" columns in the users viewList have been
   shortened to just the dates.
 * Fixed bug; A gene's hidden curators and collaborators should only be viewable
   on that gene's viewEntry page by collaborators or higher.
 * Added panelid and panel_size to the Individuals table, to distinguish between
   individuals and panels.
 * The VariantOnTranscript/DBID field has been removed in favor of the
   VariantOnGenome/DBID field.
 * A new authentication method is introduced, storing the user's passwords even
   more safely as before. The user account password stores are only updated one
   by one, whenever a user logs in.



/*******************
