// DMD_SPECIFIC: CHECK THE DATE OF THE RELEASES IN THE CHANGELOG!!!

/*******************
 * 3.0 Alpha 03
 * 2011-08-01
 *********/
 * Fixed bug; The verification of the LOVD database URL did not work, actually
   because of a problem in the script on the LOVD website.
 * Fixed bug; When selecting curators for a gene, if the viewList with available
   users was sorted or searched, the users could no longer be selected.
 * Fixed bug; When selecting curators for a gene, clicking on the user's name
   led to execution of javascript outside the scope of the page, resulting in a
   blank page with only "true" on it.
 * Fixed bug; Users can no longer remove a user as curator for a gene, when this
   user has an equal or higher level than themselves.
 * Fixed bug; Fixed notices when not properly selecting a curator for a gene.
 * Added the "Order" column in the custom columns viewList.
 * Simplified the check on the regular expression syntax of a custom column.
 * Fixed bug; On the gene viewEntry pages one of the headers was malformed.
 * Implemented option for curators to sort the list of curators for their genes.
 * Implemented lovd_isAuthorized() for checking a user's authorization for dif-
   ferent data types. Currently, only genes are implemented. The user's level,
   if lower than LEVEL_MANAGER, will no longer be defined in inc-auth.php.
 * Curators of any gene can now also check LOVD's update status. The link to
   this page is now only active for Curators and up.
 * Added navigation for Curators from the gene viewEntry page to forms to edit a
   gene, add a transcript to a gene, and sort the list of curators. Those pages
   are now also opened up to Curators.
 * Minimum MySQL version needed to run LOVD 3.0 is now 4.1.1.
 * Added lovd_php_htmlspecialchars() function that also works recursively.
 * Added array_merge() optimization where possible.
 * Fixed bug; Values of custom columns configured as simple drop down lists were
   lost during edit of the data entry.
 * Fixed bug; On the genomic variant data entry form, "Owner of individual"
   should be "Owner of variant". Also other forms had this error.
   (thanks to Raymond Dalgleish, University of Leicester, UK, for reporting)
 * Links to OMIM are now to OMIM.org and not to the NCBI site anymore.
 * Fixed bug; The user's viewList and viewEntry reported collaborators as being
   curators for the genes they are collaborators for.
 * Implemented lovd_isAuthorized() checks for diseases and transcripts, so that
   curators can correctly be recognized as authorized users.
 * Added virtual user level LEVEL_OWNER, assigned by lovd_isAuthorized() to sub-
   mitters who are owner or creator of a certain data entry.
 * Fixed too big Variant/DBID size on the data entry form.
 * Fixed bug and standardized code for checks on ownerid and statusid.
 * Fixed bug; Internet Explorer "forgot" which columns where hidden from view in
   viewLists when searching or sorting them.



/*******************
 * 3.0 Alpha 02
 * 2011-07-05
 *********/
 * Fixed bug; Windows systems will now be able to send mails to the users when
   using reset password.
 * Fixed bug; Appropriate email headers are now added to the LOVD system mail
   function.
 * Fixed bug; Temporary fix for the memory leak in /genes?create.
 * Fixed bug; Order of custom columns is now set correctly when enabled.
 * Create, edit & delete phenotype are now implemented and working properly.
 * User authorization level is now searchable in viewLists.
 * Custom columns can now be removed.
 * Adapted the page for phenotype create a bit.
 * Changed & to W3C compliant &amp; in HTML output.
 * Some LOVD 2.0 -> LOVD 3.0 code standardizations.
 * Some code optimizations.
 * insertEntry() and updateEntry() don't need to implode array values,
   lovd_queryDB() does that for them already.
 * Changed "variant information entry" to "variant entry".
 * Added new logos for gene database create and edit.
 * Removed remaining carriage returns in all files except the
   config.ini.php-lovd.
 * Removed internal LOVD columns from the VariantsOnTranscripts' viewList and
   viewEntry.
 * Fixed bug; Non-shared custom columns couldn't be removed.
 * Used CURRENT_PATH instead of (possibly concatenated) $_PATH_ELEMENTS calls.
 * Added new screening techniques to the "Screening/Technique" column.
 * Fixed bug; The "VariantOnTranscript/RNA" and "VariantOnTranscript/Protein"
   columns were non-mandatory by mistake.
 * Fixed bug; The "updated" column in the genes viewList did not allow for date
   type searching because lovd_getColumnType() did not recognize it.
 * Fixed bug; Notices were thrown when searching in date columns using
   incomplete date ranges.
 * Cleaned out the 2Do.txt file; bugs that had been fixed already were removed.
 * Added anchor in columns viewList.
 * The "Last login" and "Started" columns in the users viewList have been
   shortened to just the dates.
 * Fixed bug; A gene's hidden curators and collaborators should only be viewable
   on that gene's viewEntry page by collaborators or higher.
 * Added panelid and panel_size to the Individuals table, to distinguish between
   individuals and panels.
 * The VariantOnTranscript/DBID field has been removed in favor of the
   VariantOnGenome/DBID field.
 * A new authentication method is introduced, storing the user's passwords even
   more safely as before. The user account password stores are only updated one
   by one, whenever a user logs in.



/*******************
 * 3.0 Alpha 01
