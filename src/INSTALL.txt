LOVD v.3.0 INSTALLATION GUIDE
=============================

REQUIREMENTS
============

LOVD 3.0 requires a webserver (preferably Apache), PHP >= 4.3.0 and 
MySQL >= 4.1.


PREPARATIONS
============

To install LOVD, first copy and rename the standard config file
config.ini.php-lovd to config.ini.php and edit it in, for example, a basic text
editor. This is absolutely mandatory, because you will need to enter the MySQL
hostname, database name, username and password here.
Please go through the entire config.ini.php file to determine if you need to
change any of the other settings.


!!!NOTE!!!
==========
A .htaccess file is put in the root directory of your LOVD installation
protecting the .ini file. This will prevent the .ini file from being viewed on
Apache HTTP servers (if configured properly), the most commonly used webserver.
If you use Apache, please check that your version and configuration support this
feature. Make sure you have the .htaccess file into your LOVD directory, on Unix
and Linux systems it's a hidden file so it can be missed easily. For the
.htaccess file to work, you need to have "Limit" and "Options" enabled in
Apache's "AllowOverride" setting.

More information about .htaccess files:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/htaccess.html

More information about AllowOverride:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#allowoverride

If you use a different webserver, make sure to configure it to deny access to
the config.ini file. LOVD will access the .ini file through the filesystem.


INSTALLATION
============

To install LOVD on a remote webserver, upload the LOVD directory with all the
files to the webserver by, for instance, FTP. If you install LOVD on your own
computer, you do not need to follow this step.

Next, point your browser to the install directory of the LOVD package.
Installation of LOVD takes just a couple of minutes. The forms should explain
itself. For more information, see the LOVD manual.
